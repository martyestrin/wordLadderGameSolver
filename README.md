This project is an algorithm that solves the Doublet Game, also known as Word Ladder. The objective of the game is to convert a designated starting word to a designated ending word, while only changing one letter at a time and being restricted to a limited dictionary. The backend is implemented in C++. Using a custom-implemented heap, I implemented A* Search to find the optimal solution to the Doublet Game. I used a Python Django Web Framework to facilitate the frontend-backend connection.
